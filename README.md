Mental Health Chatbot
This is the title and a short description of my project — so visitors understand it’s a Streamlit-based chatbot focused on mental health support using emotion-based responses.

Dataset Used
I used a custom-made JSON file (dataset.json). This part explains:

It’s not a huge machine learning dataset.

It contains intents (like "I feel sad") and predefined responses ("I'm here for you").

It’s made for rule-based logic, not AI.

Approach Summary
This tells readers how the chatbot works, in simple terms:

It matches what the user says with patterns (e.g., "I'm anxious").

It shows a friendly response from the JSON file.

It’s built using Streamlit, so it has a clean UI and runs in a browser.

This is great if someone wants to understand the logic without digging into the code.

Dependencies
This lists the Python packages you used:

Mainly Streamlit.

This helps others install the right tools to run the project.

Run Locally
This section gives the exact command someone needs to run the chatbot:
Just open a terminal, run streamlit run app.py, and the chatbot will launch.

Note
This is a responsible reminder:

The chatbot offers support, but not medical advice.

It's helpful, but not a replacement for therapy or professional mental health help.
